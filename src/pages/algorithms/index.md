## Algorithms

An algorithm is like a recipe. It's a series of steps you take in order to achieve a specific outcome.
There are certain requirements that an algorithm must abide by:
<ol>
  <li>Definiteness: Each step in the process is precisely stated</li>
  <li>Effective Computability: Each step in the process can be carried out by a computer.</li>
  <li>Finiteness: The program will eventually successfully terminate.</li>
</ol>

Some common types of algorithms include sorting algorithms, search algorithms, and compression algorithms.

freeCodeCamp's curriculum heavily emphasizes creating algorithms. This is because learning algorithms is a good way to practice programming skills. Interviewers most commonly test candidates on algorithms during developer job interviews.
