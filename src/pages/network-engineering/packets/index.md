## Packets

Packets are discrete chunks of data that we use to transfer data over the internet. 
These packets are small pieces of a larger file or image (the data being transfered). 
Each packet can take a different route in order to reach its destination.
Packets may not arrive in the order they were sent.
Each packet has from address and a to address.
When all packets have reached the destination they are arranged in the correct order then displayed.
If there is a problem transmitting the data TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) will request them to be resent.
