## React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Because React is a JavaScript library, React runs in the browser, NOT on the server. This makes React very fast due to not having to wait for server responses. 

React is used for building user interfaces: User interfaces is what the user sees on their screen and interacts with to use your web app. This interface is split up into components, instead of having one huge page you break it up into smaller pieces known as components. In more general terms, this approach is called Modularity.

It's declarative: React uses a declarative paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application. It's efficient: React computes the minimal set of changes necessary to keep your DOM up-to-date. And it's flexible: React works with the libraries and frameworks that you already know.

To describe component's DOM representations, React uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. A simple transform is included with React that allows converting JSX into native JavaScript for browsers to digest.
